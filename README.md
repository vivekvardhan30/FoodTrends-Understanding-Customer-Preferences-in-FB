**🍽️Customer Sentiment Analysis Dashboard – Power BI**

**📘 Overview**

As part of the Customer Sentiment Analysis of Food Reviews project, I contributed end-to-end to the design, analysis, and visualization of customer feedback data using Power BI. My focus was on transforming raw feedback into meaningful insights that help food brands understand customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and sentiment trends.

**🚀 Objectives**

- Clean, standardize, and unify customer feedback data.

- Identify sentiment trends (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

- Evaluate product-level performance (taste, price, satisfaction).

- Develop customer personas based on sentiment and feedback behavior.

- Create dynamic, interactive dashboards for decision-making.
